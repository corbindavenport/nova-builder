N0VA Builder
============

N0VA Builder is a Technic Launcher modpack builder written in bash script. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X, Android with Busybox, or almost any other Unix system. Here are the system requirements:

 * **Linux** - needs the bash, rm, mv, wget, zip, and unzip GNU utilities (almost every distro has these)
 * **Mac OS X** - needs a wget binary, which included with Mac OS X downlad
 * **Android** - Needs to be rooted, have the Busybox utilites (installer available [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox)), and have a terminal emulator to run the script
 
To run N0VA Builder, clone the repository or download the zip, open the folder for your system (Android uses the Linux version), and open the N0VA script.

Please see the Wiki for full documentation on how to use N0VA Builder. You can also view basic instructions by using the -help paremeter while running the builder.
